| Extension Build File
+==========================================================================
| YOU MUST DO THESE TWO THINGS FIRST!
|
| 1) name = Classname of the main class for the extension
| 2) swworkdir = Absolute path to StencylWorks workspace directory.
| 
| The location of this directory can be found in Preferences > Workspace
| If it's "Stencylworks Installation Directory", it's just the path to
| StencylWorks itself. If it's something else, it's that path + /stencylworks/.
|
| (If you don't know what this path is, ask how on the forums!)
+==========================================================================
| dist - Builds a JAR file for the extension and drops it into the
| StencylWorks extension directory.
