# A macro is a set of characters that is replaced by other characters when the dialog is read in.
# They could be useful for generally making certain tags much shorter and easier to call, or for combining multiple tags commonly used together into one.
# Macros are also further diided into "Normal" and "Special".
# A "Normal" macro is surrounded in {curly braces}. Characters will only be read as a macro if found inside curcly braces in your dialog.
#
# Normal Macro
# {id} -> replace with
# Used in dialog like ...{id}...
# Turns into: ...replace with...
#
# A "Special" macro is one which will always be read as a macro. Be careful not to use a character that's bound to show up often in dialog.
# Another feature of a special macro is that it can come in pairs. When multiple special macros are found, each instance may be replaced by different text, which can be handy for using a single character for both the opening and closing of a pair of tags.
#
# Special Macro
# !X -> replace with
# Used in dialog like ...X...
# Turns into: ...replace with...
# Or
# !X...X -> first replacement...second replacement
# Used in dialog like ...X...X...
# Turns into: ...first replacement...second repalcement...
#
# In each case the macro definition begins with ! followed by a single character to be used as the identifier.
# If a character is defined here as a special macro, that character will need to be escaped to be used in dialog. \X

# Examples of probably not highly used characters that might be good to use for special macros:
# @, #, $, %, ^, &, *, -, _, =, +, ~, `, |
