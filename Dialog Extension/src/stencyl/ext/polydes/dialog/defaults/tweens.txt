# Settings:
#
# duration=1000, tween lasts for 1000 milliseconds (1 second)
# All following values may have a start + stop, or just one which remains constant, or no value for default
# position=(x y), point on screen, or (x% y%), dynamic position on screen, or any combination of the two. (0% aligns to left of screen, 100% aligns to right)
# positionScaleAnchor=(x% y%), if tween scales, then this will keep some point aligned on the scaled and unscaled. ex: (50% 0%) will make the image seem to grow away from the center of the top.
# scale=(1 .1) scales width to 100%, height to 10%.
# opacity=1, 100% opaque
